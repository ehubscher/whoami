This repo is for aiding in interfacing with my colleagues and to help set realistic expectations in my professional development alike.

## Introduction

The focus of this document will provide clarity on how my flavour of neuro-divergence, Executive Dysfunction, and ADHD can affect my work and what I've discovered works best for me so that I can play more optimally to my strengths rather than battling with my weaknesses unnecessarily. This document is not a white paper on the science behind neuro-divergent spectrum disorders, the intricacies of Executive Dysfunction, or ADHD in general. What this document does intend to do, however, is shine a light on the manifestation of Adult ADHD within myself, how it affects me in the workplace, and what my colleagues can expect when getting to know me, work with me.

If you are reading this document and your instinct is to opine towards:

    "Well, we all get distracted sometimes..."

*or*

    "Well, don't we all kinda have a little bit of ADHD..."

*or*

    "I think it's just a set of personality traits, ADHD doesn't actually exist..."

I invite you to listen to a detailed, research-driven, and scientific fact based presentation given by the man at the bleeding edge of ADHD research and world-reknown psychologist, Dr. Russell Barkley. The YouTube playlist of Dr. Barkley's presentation can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhbAK1pdPM&list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY).

## My Most Notable "Quirks"

### Time blindness

#### What does it *look* like?

1. Not knowing what day of the week it is.
2. Being almost completely unable to estimate time-based tasks.
3. Struggling heavily with time-based tasks (i.e. time-based exams, tight deadlines, showing up to meetings on time, etc.)

__e.g.__

1. Take a "15 minute break" from work to make some lunch.
2. Get distracted: "Might as well watch some YouTube since I'm eating anyway..."
3. At least an hour passes by.
4. Ends up working later.

#### What does it *feel* like?

1. Constant feeling of frustration toward self for not being able to organize self across time effectively in a similar way that colleagues might, despite the effort.
2. Constant feeling of guilt and shame when late, yet again, or missed a deadline, yet again.

#### What helps me mitigate this symptom?

1. Patient managers/Scrum Masters.
2. Artificial deadlines.
3. Timers.
4. Alarms.

### Day-dreaming and Pathological Boredom

#### What does it *look* like?

1. Spacing out for hours at a time.
2. Staring into space, appearing deep in thought for extended periods of time.
3. Lots of activity, little productivity.
4. Constantly looking for novelty and new projects.

__e.g.__

1. Reading an article about alcoholism.
2. Reminded of a high school friend who grew up in an abusive home and became an alcoholic.
3. Begin contemplating the effect of nature vs. nurture in parenting dynamics with children.
4. Opens Wikipedia page about childhood psychology.
5. Gets led down rabbit-hole of history of modern psychology, Freud, Jung, etc.
6. You get the idea.

#### What does it *feel* like?

1. Always wanting to know the "answer" or the "source" to an idea.
2. Only being able to work on tasks that are "interesting".

#### What helps me mitigate this symptom?

1. Starting new projects, or PoCs.
2. Being involved in R&D or having to research new tech stack, etc.
3. Focus on tasks that align with interests, otherwise boredom will paralyze productivity.
4. Adopting XP Agile methodology.
5. Paired Programming works wonders for me.

### Poor working memory

#### What does it *look* like?

1. "Forgets" certain immediate priorities.
2. Inability to multi-task.

#### What does it *feel* like?

1. Constant sensation of forgetting something important and never being able to remember what it could be.
2. Seriously researching early onset Alzheimer's.

#### What helps me mitigate this symptom?

1. If someone asks me to do something, I must force myself to do it immediately or I *will* forget. The only task that exists in my brain, is the one I am currently doing.
2. If it is not an immediate priority, I must map reminders to my external environment (i.e. notes that have colours, reminders with alarms/sounds, etc.)

### Overwhelm

#### What does it *look* like?

1. "Laziness".
2. Paralysis.
3. Un-productiveness.
4. Slow to start.

#### What does it *feel* like?

1. The title speaks for itself. Not being able to prioritize large list of important tasks.
2. Trouble breaking down tasks into granular sub-tasks.

#### What helps me mitigate this symptom?

1. Working with Scrum Master/Squad
2. Do one extremely small task at a time.
3. Have only one task in the pipeline. Add one more when the pipeline empties. So that's a *maximum of two* tasks on the Agile Board at any given time.
